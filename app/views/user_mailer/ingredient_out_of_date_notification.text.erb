Hi <%= @user.name %>,

Here's a list of the items in your cupboards going out of date in the next week, and the day they will be going out of date:

<% @stock_going_off.each do |stock|%>
- <%= stock.ingredient.name %> (<%= stock.use_by_date.to_s(:long)%>)
<% end %>

That's everything!

Thanks,
Stockcubes Team

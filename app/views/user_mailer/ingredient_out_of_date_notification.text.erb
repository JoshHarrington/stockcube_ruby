Hi <%= @user.name %>,

Here's a list of the items in your cupboards going out of date in the next week:

<% @stock_going_off.each do |cupboard_id, stocks| %>
<%= Cupboard.find(cupboard_id).location %>
<% stocks.each do |stock| %>
- <%= stock.ingredient.name %> (<%= stock.use_by_date.to_s(:long)%>)
<% end %>

<% end %>

If you don't want to get these notifications, you can always <%= link_to "update your settings", user_url(@user.id) %>.

Thanks,
Stockcubes Team

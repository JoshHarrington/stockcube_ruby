Hi <%= @user.name %>,

Here's a list of the items in your cupboards going out of date in the next week, and the day they will be going out of date:

<% @stock_going_off.each do |cupboard_id, stocks| %>
	<%= Cupboard.find(cupboard_id).location %>
	<% stocks.each do |stock| %>
	- <%= stock.ingredient.name %> (<%= stock.use_by_date.to_s(:long)%>)
	<% end %>

<% end %>

That's everything!

Thanks,
Stockcubes Team

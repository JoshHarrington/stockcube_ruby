				<p>"<strong>Use by dates</strong> indicate when a product may no longer be safe to eat. You should not eat, cook, or freeze it after the date displayed, even if it looks or smells fine. <br/><strong>Best before dates</strong> are an indication of quality rather than safety. You can still eat food after its best before date, but its flavour and texture is most likely not as good as before the date"</p>
